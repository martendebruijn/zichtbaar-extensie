// Listening to commands
// As the manifest key name implies, suggested_key is only a suggestion for key binding.
// That suggestion will be taken into consideration only if the key is not already assigned
// to another command.
// Another thing to have in mind is that suggested keys are only considered when an extension is
// first installed. Disabling and enabling, updating, or reloading won't have any effect. So if
// you just changed the suggested key in your manifest and want to test it, you have to uninstall
// the extension and install it again.
// Works for me tho ^ just updating works
// But you do have to re-install the whole thing if you didn't had commands before
