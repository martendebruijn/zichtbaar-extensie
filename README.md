## Introduction
This Chrome extension is part of my ([Marten de Bruijn](https://marten.work/)) graduation project of Communication Multimedia and Design @Avans university of applied science, Breda. This extension adds accessibility enhancements to websites for blind people (who can't see their screens).

## Development
This extension is currently **in development**. 

### TODO

- [x] language feature
- [ ] quick nav feature
- [ ] add popup banner etc
- [ ] add 128(?)px icon

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/martendebruijn/zichtbaar-extentie.git
```

2. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Make sure developer mode is on.
4. Press "Load unpacked" in the top right.
5. Load the directory.
6. Enjoy :)

### Background script
All tasks that have to run in the background go inside the background script. You can inspect the background page by clicking on ‚ÄòInspect views background page‚Äô in the manage extensions page.

#### On installed event
```js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function () {
  ...
});
```

#### On page changed

I'm not entirely sure what this code does, but it is in the Google documentation.

```js
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, function () {
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([
      {
        conditions: [
          new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
            pageUrl: { hostEquals: 'developer.chrome.com' },
          }),
        ],
        actions: [new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowPageAction()],
      },
    ]);
  });
```

### Popup page
You can declare a popup page. This page will open when the user clicks on the extension. The popup page needs to be called popup.html. The popup will be treated as a whole different page next to the visited webpage. This means that it has its own styles and console. To inspect this page, press right click on the popup and then on ‚ÄòInspect‚Äô.

### Options page
You also can declare an options page. This page is used to give the user options¬†to change the extension. The options page can be found on the manage extensions page in Chrome:
1. Go to manage extensions
2. Go to the extension
3. Click on details
4. Click on Extension options

### Development
There are a couple of steps you have to do before you can go coding your extension. Firstly you have to turn on the developer mode. You can do this by going to the manage extensions page and turn the switch on in the top-right corner. \n

Now you can load your extension. This can be done by clicking ‚Äòload unpacked‚Äô in the top-left corner. Every time there are changes made to the extension, it has to be updated to add these changes.

#### Logging
It‚Äôs very important to understand that the extension consist out multiple ‚Äì and different ‚Äì pages, each with its own scope (and thus console). This means you probably have to send data across the different pages. 

## Send JS code from popup to content
You can do all kind of fun stuff with the content of a webpage with your extension. To do this you will have to send code from the popup page to the webpage. You can do this either immediately by opening the popup or if you rather want to wait when the user does a specific action, you can send the code when the user presses a button for example.
There are three ‚Äì as I know of ‚Äì ways to do this:

1. activate a separate file
2. send code directly
3. activate a separate file with some data 
   
### Activate a separate file
To activate a separate file you can use this function:
```js
function connectJS(pathToFile) {
  chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function (tabs) {
    chrome.tabs.executeScript(tabs[0].id, {
      file: pathToFile,
    });
  });
}
```

### Send code directly
This can be done by changing ‚Äòfile‚Äô to ‚Äòcode‚Äô and put all the code inside a string. I tend to not do this because you have to put everything inside a string. That‚Äôs also why there isn‚Äôt an example of this method (however, this method is being used in the next method combined with the first one).

### Activate a file with data
To activate a separate file and send data from the popup page to the content, you can use the following (the data is called options).

```js
function connectJSwithOptions(options, pathToFile) {
  // connect a JS file with data ('options')
  chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function (tabs) {
    chrome.tabs.executeScript(
      tabs[0].id,
      {
        code: 'const options = ' + JSON.stringify(options),
      },
      function () {
        chrome.tabs.executeScript({
          file: file,
        });
      }
    );
  });
}
```
## Welcome message
The user gets a greeting on the popup page. Depending on the time it will give a different greeting. 

```html
<!-- popup.html 
Welcome! -->
<p><span id="welcomeMsg">Welkom</span><span id="userName"></span>!</p> 
```

```js
// popup.js
function welcomeMessage() {
     getTime();
     getUser();
}
function getTime() {
 const currentDate = new Date();
 const time = currentDate.toLocaleTimeString(); // => 13:01:42
 const welcomeMsg = document.getElementById('welcomeMsg');
 if (time >= '17:00:00') {
   welcomeMsg.innerText = 'Goedemorgen '; // Goodmorning
 } else if (time >= '12:00:00') {
   welcomeMsg.innerText = 'Goedemiddag '; // Goodafternoon
 } else if (time >= '06:00:00') {
   welcomeMsg.innerText = 'Goedeavond '; // Goodevening
 } else if (time >= '00:00:00') {
   welcomeMsg.innerText = 'Goedenacht '; // Goodnight
 }
}
function getUser() {
 const username = document.getElementById('userName');
 chrome.storage.sync.get('user', function (data) {
   // gets username
   if (data.user) {
     // if username exist do:
     username.innerText = data.user; // insert username in popup
   } else {
     username.remove(); // if username doesn't exist (null) => remove span#userName
   }
 });
}
```
